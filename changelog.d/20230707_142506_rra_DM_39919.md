### Backwards-incompatible changes

- The `NEOPHILE_COMMIT_NAME` environment variable is no longer supported. Instead, `NEOPHILE_USERNAME` configures the GitHub username of the running instantiation of neophile, used as both the name for Git commits and to construct the email address unless `NEOPHILE_COMMIT_EMAIL` is given. `NEOPHILE_USERNAME` defaults to `neophile-square[bot]`, the instantiation of neophile for the lsst-sqre organization.

### New features

- Setting `NEOPHILE_COMMIT_EMAIL` is now optional. If not set, the UID of the GitHub user from `NEOPHILE_USERNAME` is retrieved from the GitHub API and used to form a standard GitHub no-replay email address.
