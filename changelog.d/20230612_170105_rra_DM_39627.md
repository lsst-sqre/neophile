### Backwards-incompatible changes

- neophile now gets the GitHub token to use for REST API requests from the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable instead of `NEOPHILE_GITHUB_TOKEN`, thus allowing it to run from inside a GitHub Action.
- When creating PRs, neophile no longer embeds the GitHub username and token in the remote URL. It instead uses the existing `origin` remote and assumes Git operations are already authenticated.
