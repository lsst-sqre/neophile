### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Support for Helm and Kustomize dependency checking and updating has been removed, along with the configuration options for Helm chart caching and version patterns in Helm charts. Mend Renovate and dependabot support Helm and Kustomize dependency checking with more features, and we haven't used this support in several years.
