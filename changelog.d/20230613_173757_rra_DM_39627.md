### Backwards-incompatible changes

- neophile is now intended to be run either via GitHub Actions or on a local checkout, and never as a Kubernetes service. The `neophile process` command, the configuration specific to that command (work area, lists of repositories), and support for running inside a virtualenv have been removed.

### Other changes

- neophile no longer creates a separate remote for pusing PRs and instead uses the `origin` remote directly.
