### Backwards-incompatible changes

- Add a new `neophile update` command that updates known dependencies in the provided tree and (if the `--pr` flag is given) creates a GitHub pull request. This replaces the `--update` and `--pr` flags to `neophile analyze`.

### New features

- Add a new `neophile check` command that checks to see if all dependencies are up-to-date and exits with a non-zero status and messages to standard error if they are not. This is intended for use as a GitHub Actions check.
- The types of dependencies to analyze may now be specified as command-line arguments to `neophile analyze` (and the new `neophile check` and `neophile update` commands). The default continues to be to analyze all known dependencies.

### Bug fixes

- `neophile analyze` now prints nothing if no pending updates were found, and omits dependency types with no pending updates from its output.
