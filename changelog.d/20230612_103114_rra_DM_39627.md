### Backwards-incompatible changes

- `neophile analyze` without the `--update` or `--pr` option now exits with non-zero status if any pending dependency updates are found.

### New features

- The types of dependencies to analyze may now be specified as command-line arguments to `neophile analyze`, rather than always analyzing every dependency type neophile knows about.

### Bug fixes

- `neophile analyze` now prints nothing if no pending updates were found, and omits dependency types with no pending updates from its output.
