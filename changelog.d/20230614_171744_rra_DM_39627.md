### Backwards-incompatible changes

- When creating PRs, neophile now must be configured as a GitHub App with a suitable application ID and private key in environment variables.
- Name and email address are now used only for Git commits, so the names of the environment variables to set them have changed accordingly to `NEOPHILE_COMMIT_NAME` and `NEOPHILE_COMMIT_EMAIL`.
