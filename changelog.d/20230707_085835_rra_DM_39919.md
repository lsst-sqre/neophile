### Bug fixes

- Use the GitHub App installation token when pushing Git changes in preparation for creating a PR rather than using the default GitHub Actions token. If the branch was pushed with the GitHub Actions token, further GitHub Actions refuse to run on that branch to avoid creating a loop, but we need GitHub Actions to run so that the dependency update PR can be automerged.
